## Android-Project-Template
Skip the process of setting up an android app by using this template.

## Prerequisites
Have an idea about:
- clean architecture
- dependancy injection

## How to use it
- Either fork or click on ```use template``` on the top.
- Clone your own repo, change app name on ```res/values/strings```.
- Edit/refractor the classes or create new ones.

## Tech Stack
- [Koin](https://github.com/google/hilt) - Dependency Injection library.
- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
    -   [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
    - [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    -   [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    -   [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
    - [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding/) - A feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
    - [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)-Component that allows easier implementation of navigation from simple button clicks to more complex patterns.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Type-safe http client
  and supports coroutines out of the box.
- [GSON](https://github.com/square/gson) - JSON Parser,used to parse
  requests on the data layer for Entities and understands Kotlin non-nullable
  and default parameters.
- [OkHttp-Logging-Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - Logs HTTP request and response data.
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines.
- [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
- [Expresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) - Library used to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.
